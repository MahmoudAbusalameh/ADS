# Introduction to machine learning
During follwoing two sessions we will continue  introducing new well known machine learning methods, suck as KNN, Naive Bayes and Random Forests methods. The sessions will take participants through the conceptual and applied foundations of supervisied machine learning techniques. Topics covered include: 
* K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)classifier 
* Naive Bayes
* Decision trees and Random Forests

## workshop Course outline
### Module 3 Supervised learning methods (KNN, Naive Bayes)
  * Theory behind the two methods and when they are used?
