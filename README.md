# Introduction to machine learning
During this session we will start introducing machine learning concepts, through the session we will introduce theory behind statical learning methods. The session will take participants through the conceptual and applied foundations of machine learning. Topics covered include: 
* What is supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcment learning. 
* Introduce the theory behind linear and logistic regression
* Practice and apply theory by implementing two projects (linear, logistic) learning models in R.

### Assignment: Titanic Data Set
For this assignment you will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in machine learning! 

you will be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased by using python this time. you need to do some additional cleaning in able to use the kaggle data in your learning model.

after your finish upload your work in the notebook format into your github account 

**Good Luck**
